JavaScript is a ubiquitous programming language with an
enormous number of uses. It is best known as the language
used to createweb pages. \cite{hid-sp18-525-java} However, its 
uses are far more than would appear. JavaScript is a flexible 
language that can function as object oriented, as well as 
procedural. \cite{hid-sp18-525-java} JavaScript has had a storied 
past. \cite{hid-sp18-525-java} Because of the uni- versal adoption 
of JavaScript, it has a bright future. JavaScript is not 
confined to rendering web content. As an object-oriented 
language, JavaScript has un- limited potential as a 
programming platform. \cite{hid-sp18-525-java}\footnote{Please check citation rules.}
